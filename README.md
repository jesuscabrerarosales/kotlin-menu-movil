# 📱 Kotlin Menu Móvil

This project is a mobile app prototype built with **Kotlin**, following clean architecture principles and **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) coding practices.

> ⚠️ This is currently a **mockup** stage project — meant for structure, layout, and architecture practice. Functionality is limited.

## 🧩 Project Overview

The goal is to design and implement a scalable mobile app structure with a clean, maintainable codebase using Kotlin for Android development.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Kotlin  
- Android Studio  
- Clean Architecture  
- XML Layouts

## 📦 Project Structure

- **presentation/** – UI components, activities/fragments  
- **domain/** – Use cases and business logic  
- **data/** – Data sources and repositories
